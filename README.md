## About me

I am a young scholar working on the history of Chinese Buddhism during the second half of the second millennium CE. My research covers the relations between state and religious institutions, the history of specific Buddhist monasteries, Buddhist canonical law (*vinaya*), as well as monastic ordinations (with a special emphasis on female ordinations). I have a strong interest in digital humanities, especially social network analysis, which I use to trace the relations between Buddhist monastics and their lay patrons.
